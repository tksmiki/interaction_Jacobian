### R codes and related files for reproducing our results are available here
You can start with <b>"ode_edm2024v4.nb_20250117.html"</b>, which is the html version of the rendered Rnotebok including the excuted results and graphics. If you would like to excute the codes by yourself, you can use the Rnotebook <b>"ode_edm2024v5.Rmd"</b>. Since some analyses (e.g. MDR S-map) need substantial computational time, you can also load some parts of results from the R object files with the extension <b>".obj"</b> and skip such analyses. <br>
Note: the above files are the latest version. The older version is "ode_edm2024v3.nb_20241028.html" and "ode_edm2024v3.Rmd". 

### Python codes are also available
If you are more familar with Python than R, the core parts of our results can be reproduced by the Python codes, summarized in the notebook style file <b>"ode_edm2024_py.nb_20250110.html"</b>. We used RStudio environment even for Python with the package reticulate in R. You can also find <b>"ode_edm2024_py.Rmd">/b> for the source of the notebook file. 

### A conceptual summary diagram for our study is also available
The core ideas can be not so transparent in our text due to many mathematical expresssions and many technical terms. You can refer <b>"concept_diagram_Jacobian_v2.pdf"</b> to overview the whole picture of the concepts and the relationships between different quantities and metrics in our study.
